## Canvas Drawing -> DropBox

Originally created for the Brooklyn Gaze installation at the Brooklyn Public Library. This web app allows users with mobile devices to draw or type on a post-it note. When saved, it gets uploaded to a DropBox folder. Coupled with the openFrameworks [BPL Post-it app](https://github.com/prismspecs/BPL-Postits) this creates a powerful interactive installation.

# Notes

Make sure to create an accesstoken.js with your own DropBox API key(s).
